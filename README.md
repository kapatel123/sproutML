Pipeline for rapid containerized model prototyping + deployment 

Rough outline of roadmap (if all comes to fruition)
- Comprehensive Data Preprocessing 
- Multi-model Comparison Pipeline (ML)
  - Evaluation Reports (values + charts) 
  - Separate NLP module for text specific tasks as repo or "plug-in"
- Flask Endpoint for Serving 
- Dockerized for easy cloud deployment 
- Reiterate and determine threshold of steps that can encompass "MOST" needs of data scientists 


Goal(s)
- Build up current knowledge on design-oriented application
  - Ex. Leverage containerized foundation for scaling purposes 
- because
